# Features

## Buy and Sell Recycled Goods:
Our app serves as the ideal platform for users looking to sell or buy recycled products. Additionally, users can exchange or donate their used items to others, creating a sharing ecosystem that contributes to waste reduction.

## Aspiration and Creativity Timeline:
This feature allows users to share their aspirations and creativity related to waste and recycling issues through text, photos, or videos. Useful information such as recycling processes, recyclable materials, recycling product tutorials, and their positive environmental impact can be accessed by all users. Thus, we can promote awareness and active participation in waste recycling efforts.

## Recycling Points System:
Users actively engaged in recycling activities, such as giving used items to others or sharing recycling-related content, will earn points. These points can be exchanged for various incentives, such as discounts at local stores, eco-friendly products, or even donations to environmental charities. Through this points system, our app provides a meaningful participation experience, stimulating environmental awareness, and empowering users on their sustainability journey.
